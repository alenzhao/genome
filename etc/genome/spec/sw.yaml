# The 'sw' configuration variable is the root directory for software
# installations.  The Genome::Sys module typically leans on OS package
# management where advanced package management exists (Debian/Ubuntu, RedHat,
# etc.).  This path is a fallback for systems with locally produced software
# which is not packaged.
